description: A crowded wedding, a dead phone, and a bench far enough away to escape the noise. Sam wanted to be alone with his thoughts—until Natalie decided to crash his bubble. A short story about unexpected honesty, "hitting it off," and the strange ways we find a dance partner.

He was sitting outside on the bench, all alone in front of the wedding tent, looking at the people drinking, talking, and dancing their brains out. It was time for the couples' dance, with the newlyweds at the center of the show.

Then, to his ever-growing dismay, someone arrived to invade the alone time he craved for overthinking and the introspection of his entire existence. She was a woman, younger and considerably prettier than his previous company, but he still wanted her to leave.

Alas, not only did she stay in his bubble, she even had the audacity to sit right next to him, blabbering words that he was not sure she even paid attention to herself.

"Man, one has no idea. This is a good spot to take it all off," the intruder said. She then moved to open her phone and scroll through it, while he gave her a quick look and proceeded to dive back into the oceans of his downcast thoughts.

There was a gap of a few seconds before she noticed him not noticing her; rather, he seemed content with everything going on inside his head. The reasonable part of her mind advised her to let it be and just mind her own damn business.

"Woah, I am so sorry if I just completely invaded your bubble..." And there she went.

"Oh, no, no. Don't worry about it," he replied with a formal empathy doused with a pint of "I don't give a shit" apathy.

"Oh, you sure about that? I mean everywhere else seems... uhm... you know, wet. Seems like the sprinklers came on lately."

"It's alright."

"Thanks."

She then wandered her eyes in almost every possible direction her head could allow, and after her brief exploration, she yet again moved her swirling attention to her disinterested benchmate.

"Sam? You are Sam, right? The best man?"

"Umm... yeah, yeah. That's right."

"It's Natalie."

"Oh, nice to meet you."

"Me too," she concluded, but by then he had already retreated into his unending thoughts.

She found herself in a troubling situation where her mind was bothered by the uncertainty of whether she was troubling him, and deep down, she was also slightly offended. Just as she was considering whether to leave, Sam subverted her expectations.

"Which side of the family did you say you are on?" he asked.

"Uhh... I didn't say anything." The sudden shift spooked her, and taking a split second to think, she came back with, "Well, I can say I'm on no one's side..."

"I mean, I guess... technically... I think it's the bride's side anyway," Natalie started, untangling the ball of wool. "I mean, I am here as a plus-one to my friend, Olivia. Who happens to be the bride's mother's second cousin's sister's niece by marriage."

Sam's visible look of confusion was noticed by Natalie, who affirmed, "You have no idea who she is, do you?"

"Nope."

"Okay. Basically, it doesn't matter. At all," Natalie started, finally meeting someone who would listen to her rant. "Basically, I came here with Olivia, and now I can't find her. Since I don't know anyone here, I am retreating to this little hideaway."

"Oh," Sam gave an obligatory smirk, "I can't blame ya."

"What's your excuse for sneaking away from the masses?" Natalie inquired. "Don't you have... best man duties to do?"

"Nah, those are done," he answered. "I just need some air. You know, I am in the quite opposite situation than you are."

"And that is?"

"I know too many people here."

"Oh... I imagine that could get a little overwhelming..."

Sam smiled, and then yet again silence befell them. He had his eyes fixed on the wedding tent; she had hers on her phone. But after some bouts of passive scrolling, she just shut it down with frustration.

"Well, when I was coming here, I told myself that I would be more social and meet new people. But then, you know, I just end up scrolling through my phone."

Sam looked at her, pursing his lips and giving an obligatory smile. But then she continued with her debacles.

"Seriously, like every time. Anytime there’s a moment of silence, I end up staring at my phone. It's terrible! I HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM!!!"

Sam kept staring at her with a visible expression of surprise, and after she was done, he gave her an amusing smile and said, "Yeah, I know what you mean."

"Oh, look at you. You haven't checked your phone once since I sat down. How is that even possible?"

"Ah... I am trying to be better about it," he said. "Also, my phone died like twenty minutes ago."

"Oh, my God! Aren't you in just agony right now?" she playfully questioned, impersonating an over-the-top persona.

"I am dying," he responded to her playful quip.

"I bet. I can't believe you are still with us."

"You have no idea. It's a miracle," he laughed, and then once again he resumed his old habit. At least, it seemed so.

"You know, I used the last of my phone battery getting over here."

"R.I.P.," she said.

"I was talking to someone's aunt," he started. "I mean, she was... she was sweet. I shouldn't have... but you know."

"Okay..." she nodded. "How did you get out of there?"

"I did a fake phone call."

"Yes, yes... you did," she said, boasting a large smile.

"You know, I actually feel terrible now, thinking about how premeditated it was," he contemplated. "Like, I set an alarm for one minute, and..."

"...answered your own alarm," she finished his sentence. "Damn, that's impressive. I think I have to see this."

"Nah..."

"Yeah..."

"On my dead phone?"

"Well, that's the challenge."

"Okay, let's see. Pretend that we are talking to each other," Sam said as he pulled out his phone. "We are talking about... let's say... uhh... traffic."

"Traffic, okay. That's good," Natalie started the mock conversation. "You know how the traffic is on 21st Street?"

"Oh yeah... awful. 25th is much better."

"Yes, exactly, but you know what? I still purposefully took 21st..." But then Natalie stopped when Sam raised his finger, pointing at his phone and asking her to stop.

"Oh... okay. What's that? I can't hear you right now." Then Sam silently moved his lips, saying, "One minute," to Natalie. She nodded her head in agreement, after which Sam rose from the bench and walked away.

Natalie remained seated on the bench, waiting for him to come back. After a little while, she turned her head to scan the surroundings for him, but to no avail.

"And he is gone," Natalie muttered, then reverted to her cell phone.

"I thought you wanted to stay away from the phone." It was Sam. He was standing in front of her, carrying two glasses of cocktails.

"I thought you would never return."

"I thought so too, but then, you know, everywhere else is kinda... wet." Sam passed one of the glasses to Natalie and sat next to her.

"That phone trick was brilliant; you are a very good liar, Sam."

"Thank you," Sam said, while hesitating to utter his next few words. "Well, can you tell me your name again?"

"It's Natalie..."

"Oh, yeah, Natalie. I am sorry, it slipped my mind."

"Oh, it's okay. You can call me Nat, too. You don't have to kill yourself over that."

"You know what," Sam started, regretting it, "it's really bad that I couldn't remember your name."

"Oh, come on. You think I remember the names of any of these people here?"

"But wait a minute," said Nat, remembering something. "There was this guy, Karl. I remember him because he told me that he liked the way I was 'put together'."

"Woah!! Okay!" he exclaimed.

"Yeah. It is as weird as it sounds."

They both chuckled, and after once again having a few moments of not talking, Sam took sips from his glass and turned his head toward Nat.

"Thanks, Nat. For being understanding."

"You know what, Sam? You just showed you can go from being full of shit to being completely honest in a matter of moments. I am completely impressed."

"Thank you."

"By the way, I liked your best man speech. It was nice, well thought out."

"Thank you."

"I feel like it must be hard, right? Writing a wedding speech that appeals to everyone. I feel like I would be that girl who would talk directly to the bride and recall all the inside jokes. I think I would try to be too funny."

"Oh, no. That's the worst—no inside jokes. Everyone would start laughing just because the bride and groom are laughing, with no idea why."

"Yeah, it's a terrible thing to do. But you... but you were really good. But there was the part at the end where you said, 'You finally found someone to dance with.' I didn't get that."

"Oh, it was just an inside joke."

"Oh, you cannot do that. No inside jokes, right? You gotta tell me what it is."

"Okay... so..." He made prolonged eye contact with Nat. "Sid has been my best friend... since I can remember."

"Okay."

"When... man! When we were younger... I don't even know where to begin. Okay, let's just spit it out."

"So, I went through an awkward phase during my high school days," he started his tale.

"Oh, I refuse to believe that," Nat responded with an obviously sarcastic comment.

"It's shocking, I know, right?" Sam followed the road of sarcasm she set. "I wasn't always this confident and, you know, 'put together'."

"What?!?! Karl will be totally disappointed."

"Where is Karl??" Sam burst out with a feeble chuckle.

"Hopefully, he left," Nat continued, and both burst into a series of prolonged laughs.

"As a kid, I was very shy," Sam continued. "That's what I am trying to say."

"Okay."

"And there was this homecoming dance. That is the first dance of the year. And there was no way I was going to ask anyone. So Sid said that we should go as stags, so there was no need to be tied to a single girl all night."

"Oh! That's one way to think about it," Nat retorted.

"So, yeah, he picked me up and we went to the dance. Him and I. And standing there, we were making fun of all the couples, telling each other how much better we were compared to them."

"I mean, it was ridiculous; Sid never had trouble with girls. He could have asked anyone and they would have agreed. But that day, I watched these girls come up to him and ask for a dance. They would talk for a while and leave. I never heard what they spoke about and always wondered how people just spontaneously strike up a conversation from thin air; it was amusing. But after talking for a while, the girls would leave. And he would always come back to me."

"After coming back, he would always say, 'I can't find anybody to dance with'."

"Aww!!!" Nat gushed, her dimples appearing. "He didn't want to leave you alone... I think that's so sweet."

"Yeah, me too."

"And now I get it: 'You finally found someone to dance with.' Yeah, that's funny."

"Yeah, I guess it is."

There were once again a few moments of silence in the air, but this time it was different. It was more familiar. And once again, Nat turned toward Sam and started a question.

"You cannot stay a wallflower forever, though, right? Some girl came along and turned you into the best man I see in front of me."

"Woah... yeah. You know, surprisingly enough, eventually, there was a girl. First love and the whole deal."

"Isn't first love just the best?"

"Hmm," Sam responded, diving deep into the depths of his past memories. "It's funny—she is here, actually."

"Your ex? Of course she is," Nat responded in amazement. "Where? Which one is she?"

Sam pointed over the crowd inside the tent. He indicated, "See there? The one wearing the white dress?"

"Yeah, I see her," Nat answered, and then, suddenly hit with a morbid realization, she said, "Wait, what? No..."

"Yes... yeah. Fate."

Nat, still in shock, found it hard to get the right words out. "Your best friend married your ex?"

"Ex-girlfriend. Yes, he did."

"Wait, wow!! That sucks."

"I know it sounds like it would be weird," said Sam, "but actually, it is really weird."

"Yeah... I mean... ah... I have so many questions."

"I bet you do."

"When did they start dating? Like, how long after you guys broke up? How did you even get along... Okay, I am sorry."

"Oh, no, it's okay," Sam laughed it out. "I got to know about them six months ago. They started dating right after I broke up with her."

"This is insane."

"Yeah, I don't know. I think it's like one of those things for them, I guess. They just hit it off. I mean, right after—maybe even before the end of us. But it's fine."

"How are you okay?" she asked. "Are you even okay?"

"Yeah... I am okay."

"Well, this is weird. I think you can just let yourself not feel okay about it, you know? Just for a minute. At their wedding."

"Yeah, I know. I know."

"Sorry, I am invested. I am just too invested in your story."

"Yeah, it's okay. I know, I know it's weird."

"It's weird," she affirmed.

"You wanna know what the weirdest part is?"

"Yes, I really wanna know."

"We had conversations about tonight. Her and I."

"About your wedding?"

"Yeah, like, really specific. What it would look like, what she would be wearing, the music and all. And this is it. That's the dress."

"I am sitting here and, for a split second, I forget that this isn't mine and she isn't mine. And this is like our amazing wedding. And I see them dancing together, and I'm like, 'Who the fuck is that guy?'"

"Your best friend."

"Yeah, my best friend."

After another bout of complete silence, Nat once again took the initiative to break it.

"They do make a really cute couple, though," she playfully said.

"Yeah, I know, right?"

"Yep, like so adorable. I don't see you guys together at all."

"Really?"

"Yeah, no, I mean..." then Nat noticed the look of intrigue on Sam's face. "I mean, what do I know? She could be an amazing woman, but I don't see you both together. I see you with, you know, someone quicker."

"Someone quicker, I see," Sam smiled, and Nat followed with her giggles.

"I think so."

Then, out of nowhere, Nat's phone beeped. She looked at it and sighed.

"Did Olivia send you an SOS?" Sam asked.

"No, it's my boyfriend. I've got to text him back," she replied. As soon as Sam heard it, his face became dominated by looks of dejection and slight, visible sadness.

"Oh, God! Sam, no."

"What?"

"No, I don't have a boyfriend. Oh, God! Your face—it looks like life was just drained out of you," Nat clarified. "I just thought it would be funny."

"No, it is funny," Sam made a failed attempt to go along with her prank.

"No, it's not funny," Nat told herself. Then, turning toward Sam, "I thought it would be so glaringly obvious that I don't have a boyfriend. I mean, can you imagine me actually saying that?"

"No... Yeah, that definitely happens. I thought it was true."

"Who are these people?"

"It's true," affirmed Sam. "You are talking with someone, and you are hitting it off."

"Are we hitting it off?" Nat inquired. "Is that what this is?"

"Uhh... yes. Yeah," Sam answered. "This is hitting it off."

"Okay, good to know."

"Never actually said that out loud before," Sam said. "Hitting it off means we are enjoying each other's company. You know, we have the same..."

"We get along," Nat continued. "It does not mean that we are flirting!"

"No."

"No."

"Flirting is a... it is a whole..." Sam started blabbering. "When I am flirting, it's much more charming. There's a great deal of natural charm that happens."

"Totally."

"There's more touching," Sam spat out a random fact. "I read that. That when people are flirting, they touch each other for no reason. So, there's unnecessary touching."

"We haven't done any of that."

"No."

"We are good," Natalie put out an unsure affirmative statement.

"Yep."

After their discussion about human flirting, they resorted to staring at the tent for no particular reason. After doing that for some time, Nat slowly raised her hand and moved it toward Sam. Slowly, she placed it over Sam's hand and patted it twice before taking it back. She then went back to pretending as if nothing had happened.

Sam sat still in his place, carrying a huge grin and hints of a blush. He then slowly raised his hand and touched Nat's, which made Nat blush like a sweet schoolgirl.

"I am getting a little worried, though," Nat said.

"Hmm?"

"About Olivia. I mean, it's been a while."

"Yeah, it has been a while."

"Yeah, I feel like... I don't know, maybe I should go and look for her." She then gave a sly look at Sam's face to note his reaction.

"Yeah, I think you should."

"Yeah, maybe. Yeah." Nat got up from the bench. "Yeah, maybe I will do that. But you're gonna be alright, right?"

"Yep, I'm gonna stay right here for a bit."

"Good," Nat said and started walking, but Sam stopped her.

"Hey, thanks for... uh... I am sure I will see you again."

"Yeah."

"Okay."

"Okay," Nat said and started walking toward the tent... her pace getting slower the closer she got to the tent.

"Hey, Nat... stop," Sam called her out.

"Yeah," Nat said, suddenly turning toward him, looking pleased that he had called her again.

"Do you wanna dance?" he asked.

"Yeah, I do," Nat answered with a swift nod, without even giving it a second thought.

"Okay," Sam boasted a big, wide grin as he got up from his bench and walked toward Nat. As they got closer, Sam raised his hand toward her and she held it.

"What about your friend, Olivia?"

"Oh, I think she will be just fine," answered Nat, as they both walked toward the wedding tent.

**The End? C'mon...I don't think so.**
