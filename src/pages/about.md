## About Vicitales

Hi there 👋, I’m Suhan.

**Vicitales** is my personal space for stories — a quiet corner of the internet where imagination, memory, and curiosity come together. The worlds you find here are shaped by moments of love, loss, chance encounters, and the small decisions that change lives in ways we rarely notice at first.

Some stories are dark, some gentle, and some unfinished. All of them are evolving.

Vicitales exists so that these stories can live outside scattered notes and dusty folders on my computer, and instead grow alongside the readers who discover them.

## More Than a Story Site

Vicitales is also my experimentation ground.

Alongside writing fiction, I use this project to explore modern web architecture and Cloudflare’s serverless platform. Many features you see here — analytics, APIs, and infrastructure experiments — are built as learning steps before being applied to larger publishing platforms.

In that sense, Vicitales is both:

- 📖 a storytelling platform  
- 🧪 a living technical laboratory

## What You’ll Find Here

- Serialized fiction and long-form stories  
- Character-driven narratives and evolving worlds  
- A calm, typography-first reading experience  
- Ongoing experiments with edge-native web technology

Every chapter published here is part of something still growing, still searching, still becoming.

Vicitales is built using the wonderful **[AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper)** theme, a minimal and beautifully crafted blog theme built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and Tailwind CSS.

AstroPaper provides the clean design, accessibility, and performance foundation that makes this reading experience possible. I’m deeply grateful to its creator and contributors for making it open source.

## A Small Note

If you choose to stay, begin anywhere.

Every story has its own way of finding you.
